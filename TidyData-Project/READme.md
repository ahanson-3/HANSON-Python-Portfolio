# 📊 Tidy Data Project 🧹

## Project Overview 💡

This project applies the principles of tidy data to clean and visualize a dataset using Python. The goal is to ensure that the dataset adheres to tidy data principles, such as:
* Each variable in its own column
* Each observation in its own row
* Each type of observational unit in its own table

In this project, a Jupyter Notebook is used to clean the data, transform it, and perform basic exploratory data analysis.

## Dataset Description 📊

This project uses 2008 Summer Olympics data given for this project. The dataset contains olympians, their gender, their events, and their medals.

### Pre-processing steps:
* Cleaned missing data and handled incorrect entries.
* Reshaped the data into a tidy format.
* Applied transformations like splitting columns or cleaning strings where necessary.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Tidy Process

The data was cleaned and transformed following the tidy data principles:
* Reshaping: Melting and pivoting the dataset as needed.
* Splitting columns: Using string functions to separate combined columns.
* Cleaning: Removing unwanted characters or handling missing values.

## 📈 Visualizations

...update... visualizations were created to explore the cleaned data. These visualizations help to better understand the insights from the dataset.

## 🧑‍💻 Pivot-Table & Aggregation

The cleaned dataset was analyzed using pivot tables to aggregate the data and compute summary statistics.
