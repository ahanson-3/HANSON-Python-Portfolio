# HANSON-Python-Portfolio

This is a Portfolio for my notable data science projects!


## Overview
Welcome to the **Portfolio**! This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for data analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and visualization. The goal is to create clean, well-structured datasets, analyze the data to uncover insights, and build predictive models. Additionally, it features a **Streamlit** app for interactive data exploration and presentation.
