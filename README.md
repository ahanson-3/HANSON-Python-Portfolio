# HANSON-Python-Portfolio

This is a Portfolio for my notable data science projects!


## Overview
Welcome to the **Portfolio**! This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for data analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and visualization. The goal is to create clean, well-structured datasets, analyze the data to uncover insights, and build predictive models. Additionally, it features a **Streamlit** app for interactive data exploration and presentation and a **Tidy Data** project.

## Project Structure

- üìÑ **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, its structure, and setup instructions.

- üßπ **`TidyData-Project`**: Contains scripts for **data cleaning** and ensuring the dataset is in a tidy format for analysis. The notebook within the folder performs data cleaning and visualization on a dataset of Olympic medalists

    - This project showcases my ability to apply data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques using Python. It highlights key skills that are essential for data analysis and machine learning, including:
    1. Tidy Data Principles ‚Äì Demonstrating an understanding of structured, well-organized datasets for effective analysis.
Data Wrangling with Pandas ‚Äì Cleaning, reshaping, and handling missing data in real-world datasets.
    2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äì Using visualizations (bar plots, heatmaps, count plots) to uncover patterns and insights.
    3. Aggregation & Pivot Tables ‚Äì Summarizing data efficiently to derive meaningful conclusions.
    4. Reproducibility & Documentation ‚Äì Writing clean, well-documented code and explanations, making the project accessible to others.

- üåê **`basic_streamlit-app`**: A basic **Streamlit** app that allows for interactive data visualization and exploration. This app focuses on Palmer Penguin data and allows you to filter to explore different results.

- üîç **`EDA`**: Scripts and notebooks for performing **exploratory data analysis** to understand the dataset‚Äôs structure, trends, and relationships.

- ü§ñ **`Models`**: Includes scripts for building **predictive models** using the cleaned data to generate insights or make predictions.

- üé® **`Visualizations`**: Scripts that generate **visualizations** to help interpret the results and communicate findings effectively.
